House Property Sales Analysis with SQL

Solving a few business tasks in order to practice SQL.

Dataset: The House Property Sales dataset on Kaggle contains a file named ‘raw_sales.csv.’ It includes the following variables:
Datesold: The date when an owner sold the house to a buyer.
Postcode: 4 digit postcode of the suburb where the owner sold the property
Price: Price for which the owner sold the property.
Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms

Business tasks:
1. Which date corresponds to the highest number of sales?
2. Find out the postcode with the highest average price per sale? (Using Aggregate Functions)
3. Which year witnessed the lowest number of sales?
4. Use the window function to deduce the top 3 postcodes by year's average price.
